## Deployment & Architecture

This project is designed with cloud-ready principles:

- **Containerized** using Docker for consistent deployment
- **Environment-based configuration** — no hardcoded secrets
- **Modular structure** for independent scaling
- **Stateless design** where applicable
- **Separation of concerns** for maintainability

### Run Locally

`ash
docker-compose up --build
`
